## Installation

You must use __npm__ __2.7.0__ or higher because of the scoped package name.

This is the command line version of the module __[@mitchallen/maze2openscad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mitchallen/maze2openscad)__.

Because this is a command line tool, you should install it using the __-g__ flag. This may require starting the command with __sudo__.

    $ npm install -g @mitchallen/maze2openscad-cli
  
* * *

## Usage

* If you don't have a copy of __OpenSCAD__ you can download it for free from here: __[http://www.openscad.org](http://www.openscad.org)__
* Create a new test folder and change to it
* Browse to: __[https://github.com/mitchallen/maze2openscad-cli/](https://github.com/mitchallen/maze2openscad-cli/)__
* Find the file __maze.scad__ in the root of the project and make a local copy of it.
* Edit the include path at the top of the file and change it to:

        include <maze-data.scad>
      
* The __maze-data.scad__ file will be generated by the tool  
* To generate a maze include file with data for 10 columns and 20 rows you could do something like this:

        $ maze2openscad-cli 10 20 maze-data.scad
        
* Start OpenSCAD and open __maze.scad__
